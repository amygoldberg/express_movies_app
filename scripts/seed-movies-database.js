// Your mission is to set up a movie review database.

// Movies have a lot of data associated with them! They have a title, a year of production, a director, and at least one actor. They also have a genre (which fr our purposes is limited to action, comedy, crime, drama, suspense, horror, romance, science fiction, fantasy, war, and western) and a rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, Foreign, Unrated, or Other).

// Most movies will have at least one review. Some will have several, and a few will have many. Reviews have a title, an reviewer, a star rating, a publication date, and a body.

// In the first phase of this project, you should create a Mongoose schema and model object according to this description, and some database seed data to verify that the schema and validation work.
